## Description

Educt learning management system (LMS) is an application where you can create and edit your courses by uploading each video lesson. You can also register your students and give them access to specific courses. With the help of the role system, you can assign your teachers so that they can also edit or create new courses. There are only three roles in the system, these are _STUDENT_, _TEACHER_ and _ADMINISTRATOR_. Your students can also correspond with you via online chat. To install the application on your server, take a look at the [installation](#Installation) chapter.
